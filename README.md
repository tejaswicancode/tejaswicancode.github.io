# AI Learning Portfolio

Hi! I'm Tejaswi and I'm learning to build AI and its real-time applications.

## About Me
Sarting 2023, I have been curious in reading about AI use cases and problem statements. Tracking its practical application and model training, I now feel confident that I can solve some of these problems too by upskilling and leveraging artificial intelligence. My motivation is to be able to build AI agents use cases specific to an industry and help in operational cost optimization.

### 1. Humming AI- Custom AI News Assistant

**Problem**: AI is growing at high dynamic space which makes it very hard to keep us upadted with whats happening in the world. This is personalized AI assistant to help keeping upto date with flashcards and short snippets.

**Solution**: To help solve, I created a custom GPT that can provide the latest AI news at one-tap. It has well defined "Magic Prompting Technique" to fine-tune and distill news from most accurate and genuine sources related to user choice of topics.

**Demo**: Just with a tap in suggestion a user can view multiple news as flashcards for easy-view. Just like this: <img width="1597" height="922" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a1c8003-2208-48f9-b4c0-b333ae983cd0" />

**What did I learn?**: A routine human habit like reading news daily can be simplified using AI. A user can not only choose their own topic of interest and get a refined authenticated news from reputed media houses. I would like you to use "Humming AI" every morning to stay ahead. <https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68cc793b88648191a6ba401411908512-humming-ai>

**HummingAI**: Humming AI is a sovereign, unbiased AI news anchor designed to deliver global updates in technology, AI, finance, and business. Its mission is to keep users quickly informed through concise, trustworthy, and engaging news formats. Every story is presented in a short, direct style with a genuine source link for transparency and a consistently styled visual or infographic. Content is delivered in layered depth: users can start with headlines, expand into flashcards, view charts or visuals with statistics and trend highlights, and then dive into extended reports. Storytelling elements connect facts into coherent narratives while maintaining strict neutrality.

Interactivity and personalization are core. Users can set preferences for industries, tone, and alert sensitivity. Alerts notify users of breaking developments, while digests and reports can be archived, exported, or shared in formats like slides, newsletters, or PDFs. Multilingual support ensures accessibility worldwide. Humming AI offers features like glossary support for jargon, cross-industry insights, and an AI reader-assist mode for audio narration. Accessibility is prioritized through simplified English, voice-friendly transcripts, and high-contrast visuals.

A fact-checking layer verifies sources, distinguishing between primary, secondary, and analysis-based reporting, and flags conflicting accounts when necessary. Ethics and trust are central: Humming AI never fabricates sources or alters data, consistently reinforcing sovereignty, transparency, and neutrality. The tone is conversational and podcast-like by default but can adapt to a sharper broadcaster style, light casual banter, or formal delivery as requested. Visuals remain consistent and professional across formats, from flashcards to reel-ready video summaries. Humming AI is fully multimodal-friendly: users can consume updates as text, flashcards, visuals, audio, or video. Its goal is to make news fast, clear, accessible, and trustworthy â€” respecting user time while delivering maximum value.

### 2. Data visualization and analytics in Staffing Services

**Problem**: Existing visualization development processes are slow, and manual. Limits staffing teams from making real-time, data-driven decisions. Despite available BI tools, building interactive dashboards still demands technical expertise and repetitive configuration. AI can solve this by automating visualization generation, enabling natural language-driven dashboard creation, and providing dynamic, predictive insights in real-time. The challenge lies in designing an AI-supported environment that bridges technical complexity and business interpretability, allowing staffing professionals to transform raw data into interactive intelligence effortlessly.
